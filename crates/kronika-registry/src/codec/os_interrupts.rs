/// The per-CPU breakdown is deliberately not stored: it multiplies the row
/// count by the CPU count for a number that only matters when chasing IRQ
/// affinity, and the aggregate is what an operator reads first. `device` is
/// the trailing free-text description; it is absent for the synthetic lines
/// (`NMI`, `LOC`, `RES`, ...) that carry no device.
