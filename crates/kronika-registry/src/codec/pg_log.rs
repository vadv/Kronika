//! Types `2_001_001`–`2_007_001`: what a `PostgreSQL` log carries.
//!
//! Seven sections, one per shape the log has. Errors and slow statements
//! arrive grouped, because a log that repeats one message ten thousand times
//! says the same thing as a count of ten thousand and costs ten thousand rows
//! to say it. The other five are one row per record.
//!
//! A nullable numeric column means the release or the message shape did not
//! print that number, not that `PostgreSQL` reported zero.
