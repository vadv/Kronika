Feature: What a PgBouncer log carries reaches the segment

  A client asking for a database the pooler does not have is refused, and
  PgBouncer writes that refusal twice: once as the reason the connection closed
  and once again as a pooler error, because `log_pooler_errors` is on by
  default. One refusal is one row.

  Scenario: A refused connection is one row, not two
    Given a PostgreSQL writing its log as stderr
    And a PgBouncer in front of it
    And a collector with these settings

    When these clients connect through PgBouncer
      | database |
      | nope     |
    And it runs for 4 seconds
    Then some segment holds these sections
      | type_id | section          | min rows |
      | 2100001 | pgbouncer_events | 1        |
    And some segment records these log events exactly once
      | type_id | column | value                  |
      | 2100001 | text   | no such database: nope |
