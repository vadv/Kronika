Feature: Which sections reach the segment, and how many rows they may hold

  Every source runs on the same one-second interval here, so each tick collects
  everything and every segment carries the full set. The list below is written
  out by hand rather than derived from the registry: a section that stops being
  collected has to fail a test, not quietly leave a generated list.

  Scenario: Every section the collector reads from this host reaches the segment
    Given a collector with these settings
      | variable                             | value |
      | KRONIKA_INTERVAL_S                   | 1     |
      | KRONIKA_SEGMENT_MAX_BYTES            | 1     |
