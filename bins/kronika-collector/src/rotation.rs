//! Storage rotation for the `KRONIKA_OUT_DIR` tree.
//!
//! Rotation keeps the whole data tree inside a fixed byte budget or a partition
//! used-fraction target by deleting the oldest replaceable data. It runs after
//! every ZMS publication and on a periodic tick, never deletes the active
//! journal or the newest finished segment, and emits a degradation event when
//! only that non-deletable minimum remains. The tree size is tracked
//! incrementally: a full scan seeds it once at startup, publications and
//! deletions adjust it, and the per-tick check stays scan-free (a scan happens
//! only when the tree is over its target or the hourly recount is due).
//! Every enforcement scan re-seeds the counter, folding in index sidecars
//! the web process published since the previous scan; the hourly recount
//! guarantees that sidecar growth is folded in even when the incremental
//! counter alone never crosses the budget. Writer temporaries count toward the
//! budget too.
//!
//! One pass deletes against a deficit computed once at its start and counts
//! every confirmed removal as reclaimed, because unlinked-but-open files
//! release their blocks only when the last reader closes them; in `auto` mode
//! those bytes stay pending until `statvfs` shows the drop, so held
//! descriptors never trigger deleting extra history.
